  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements: UserDataPage is created with a user table, Add User dialog, Delete User with confirmation, default admin seeding in useAuth, and profile photo upload/preview. The navigation route and useAuth hook are updated accordingly. However, some acceptance criteria have gaps, particularly around the role dropdown options (spec says 'Cashier/Technician' but implementation uses 'Kasir/Teknisi'), and the 'edit dialog avatar replacement' feature appears to be implemented as an inline table hover action rather than an edit dialog. Overall coverage is high.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Role dropdown options should include 'Cashier' and 'Technician' (English labels as specified: Admin, Cashier, Technician)",
      "reason": "The spec AC for REQ-2 states Role select options: 'Admin / Cashier / Technician'. The implementation uses 'Kasir' and 'Teknisi' (Indonesian labels) instead of 'Cashier' and 'Technician'.",

      "reason": "The diff summary describes a hover-to-replace camera overlay on the table row avatar, not an 'edit dialog' flow. There is no evidence of a separate edit dialog for replacing a photo; the replacement appears to be inline in the table rather than in a dedicated edit dialog.",
