  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by fixing admin login authentication in useAuth.ts and LoginPage.tsx. The useAuth.ts now stores plain-text passwords, seeds the DEFAULT_ADMIN ('admin'/'admin123') on initialization, and performs direct string comparison during login. LoginPage.tsx handles the login flow correctly, shows error messages, and relies on App.tsx's conditional rendering to redirect on success. localStorage is used as the persistence layer. All four acceptance criteria appear to be satisfied. One hallucinated feature was added: a new useQueries.ts file with React Query hooks for backend operations, which was not requested.",
