  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for REQ-1 across both frontend and backend. ProductsPage.tsx now uses both backendRole (from useUserRole) and localIsAdmin (from useAuth) with a fallback mechanism to correctly identify admin users. useUserRole.ts fetches the role from the backend canister. The backend main.mo correctly enforces admin-only access for addInventoryItem using AccessControl.hasPermission with #admin. The canAdd/isAdmin logic in ProductsPage.tsx also preserves restriction for non-admin roles. All acceptance criteria appear addressed.",
