  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented. REQ-1 is addressed in useAuth.ts with robust admin credential seeding and reset logic, and REQ-2 is addressed in LoginPage.tsx with defensive try/catch error handling and user-friendly error messages. However, REQ-2 specifically requires an error boundary or equivalent wrapping the login form — the diff shows try/catch in the submit handler but no evidence of a class-based ErrorBoundary or React error boundary wrapping the LoginPage component itself to catch render-time errors.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Wrap the login form in an error boundary or add defensive checks so that any runtime error displays a user-friendly fallback message instead of a blank/crashed page.",
      "reason": "The LoginPage.tsx uses try/catch only in the async submit handler. There is no React ErrorBoundary class component or equivalent wrapper around the LoginPage render tree to catch render-time JavaScript errors. The App.tsx wraps useAuth() in a try/catch but does not wrap LoginPage in an error boundary. Runtime render errors inside LoginPage would still result in a blank/crashed page.",
