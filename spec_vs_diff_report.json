  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (Edit button/menu for user authorization on UserDataPage) and REQ-2 (fix authorization check on ProductsPage). REQ-1 is addressed via an edit dialog in UserDataPage.tsx with role/permissions pre-fill using useAuth. REQ-2 is addressed in ProductsPage.tsx by reading currentUser?.userRole from useAuth for the canEdit guard. Both requirements appear to be substantially implemented based on the diff evidence.",

      "description": "A separate 'Otorisasi' (Authorization) action button in addition to the Edit and Delete buttons per user row (three action buttons per row total)",
      "reason": "The build request only asked for an Edit button/menu action to modify role and permissions. The file summary for UserDataPage.tsx explicitly mentions 'three action buttons per row (Otorisasi, Edit, Hapus)', which is a separate authorization-only button not requested in the spec.",
